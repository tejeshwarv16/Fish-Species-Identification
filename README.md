# Fish Species Identification

This project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify fish species based on images. The model is trained on a dataset of various fish species and deployed using Streamlit for an interactive web application.

## Features
- Custom CNN model for fish species classification.
- Streamlit-based web interface for user interaction.
- Easy-to-use interface for uploading and predicting images.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN.
- **Streamlit**: Web framework for the application.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For model development and experimentation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
3. Run `streamlit run app.py` to start the web app locally.
